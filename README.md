# Blender to React Three Fiber JSX Export (Alpha)


![image](https://github.com/sinanisler/react-three-fiber-blender-addon/assets/1686324/d38b134c-e7a2-454e-9d31-03c31ad69248)


Current idea is to copy the JSX code from Blender to React Three Fiber.
Supporting basic primitives like cube, sphere, cylinder, cone, plane, torus, torusknot, text, etc.
